  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4


  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  
  The four rules presented for determining what 'this' in JavaScript points to boil down to one simple question: What is the calling object?


1. Is the function called by new?
2. Is the function called by .call(), .apply(), or .bind()?
3. Is the function called as a method, ie: obj.func()?
4. Is the function called in the global scope?
    If strict mode is enabled, return undefined.
    Otherwise, return the global object, ie: window.



    By Example:


    1. Global Binding: 
          Is the function called in the global scope?
          If strict mode is enabled, return undefined.
          Otherwise, return the global object, ie: window/console.log() object

          Example: 
              function sayName(name){
                 console.log(this)
                    return name;
              } 

                sayName("jcork4real");

    2.  Implicit Binding:
           Is the function called as a method, ie: obj.func()?

           Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object left of the dot gets 'this'

           Example:

                    const myObj = {
                      greeting: 'Hello',
                      sayHello: function(name){
                        console.log(`${this.greeting} my name is ${name});
                        console.log(this)
                      }
                    };
                        myObj.SayHello('Ryan')


    3.    New Binding: 
                Is the function called by new?
            
              Example:
                        function CordialPerosn(greeter){
                          this.greeting = 'Hello';
                          this.greeting = greeter; 
                          this.speak = function(){
                            console.log(this.greeting + this.greeter);
                          };
                        }

                        const jerry = new CordialPerson('Newman');
                        const newman = new CordialPerson('Jerry');

                    Whenever a constructor function is used, this referes to the specific instance of the object that is
                    created and is returned by the constructor function.

    4.   Explicit Binding: 
              Is the function called by .call(), .apply(), or .bind()?

              const jerry = new CordialPerson('Newman');
              const newman = new CordialPerson('Jerry');

              jerry.speak.call(newman);
              newman.speak.apply(jerry);

              newman.speak();
              jerry.speak();


          Wehnever JavaScripts call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
